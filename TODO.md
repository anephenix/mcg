# TODO List

- [x] Replace jest with Mocha
- [x] Use NYC for Code coverage
- [x] Make note why `test` folder is used rather than `test`, as unit tests would delete `test` folder for mcg.bin.js
- [ ] Convert the codebase to TypeScript
- [x] Setup the codebase to publish NPM versions automatically
- [ ] Be able to pass --timestamps as an optional feature
- [ ] Pass attributes to setup in the model e.g. title:string description:text published:boolean
- [ ] Be able to specify relationships to other models
- [ ] Specify validation requirements in some way
