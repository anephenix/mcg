# NOTES

The dream scenario would be to generate a set of Objection.js models and supporting files from a database schema definition, so that standing up an API for a product can happen in no time.

### TODO features

-   Customise the name of the test folder (some repos have 'test' or 'spec' instead of tests)
-   Adjust the name for the seed data file to /data/modelData.test.js

-   Be able to pass --timestamps as an optional feature
-   Pass attributes to setup in the model e.g. title:string description:text published:boolean
-   Be able to specify relationships to other models
-   Specify validation requirements in some way
