A Node.js library and CLI for generating Objection.js Models and their supporting files. It helps to save time creating Models and their migrations, so that you can focus on implementing the business logic for your Node.js server-side project.

### Features

-   Creates an Objection.js model file via the commandline
-   Creates the model's knex.js migration file for the model's database table
-   Create a test model file in the **tests** folder by default
-   Create a test seed data file in the **tests**/data folder by default

### Dependencies

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
-   [Objection.js](https://vincit.github.io/objection.js/)
-   [Knex.js](http://knexjs.org)

### Install

```shell
npm i @anephenix/mcg
```

### Usage

You can use MCG via the command line:

```shell
npx mcg Post
```

This will do the following:

-   Create a folder called models, unless it already exists
-   Create a model file called Post.js in the models folder
-   Create a folder called migrations, unless it already exists
-   Generate a migration file to create the posts table with the created_at and updated_at timestamp fields.

You can also use MCG programmatically, like this:

```javascript
const mcg = require('@anephenix/mcg');
(async () => {
	await mcg('Post');
})();
```
